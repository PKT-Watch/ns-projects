## Project summary

Minr is a cross-platform desktop application designed to simplify the installation and use of the PKT Cash announcement mining software, PacketCrypt. The objective of this project is to minimise the barrier-to-entry associated with running the command-line PKT Cash miner and simplify the onboarding process while also providing an enhanced user experience for those more familiar with mining PKT Cash.

The application runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It has a simple-to-use user interface and allows for full configuration of PacketCrypt without the user needing to interact with the command-line application.

Minr includes many additional features over and above those available in PacketCrypt, such as scheduling, saved configurations, on-the-fly configuration changes, a friendly onboarding process, integration with block explorers, and analytical data presented clearly using charts and graphs.

Below is a screenshot of the application running on MacOS:
