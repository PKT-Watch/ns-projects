## Project summary

Watchr is a mobile application that allows users to view balances, transactions, and mining income for any PKT Cash wallet address. The objective of this project is to provide a performant way for users to view vital wallet information without the need to run a wallet on their device.

The application runs on the vast majority of iOS, iPadOS, and Android devices and is available for free in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

Watchr provides many features that are unavailable in some or all of the many PKT Cash wallets, including the ability to organise multiple wallet addresses into portfolios, view information about any wallet address no matter which wallet software is used to manage that address, and view balance and transaction history without the need to synchronise data with the PKT Cash blockchain.

Below is a screenshot of the application running on iPhone and iPad simulators:
