## Project summary

PKT Explorer is a block explorer for the PKT Cash blockchain. It is a front-end for the [pkt-explorer-backend](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pkt-explorer-backend) API. The objective of this project is to provide a modern and feature-rich block explorer for the PKT Cash blockchain that is simple to deploy, requires minimal configuration, and is capable of running on Windows, Linux, or MacOS servers.

The project includes an attractive light and dark theme for both mobile and desktop and is ready to deploy as-is, but is also designed to be as simple as possible for developers to customise, with clearly named and categorised Javascript and CSS (SCSS) source files. The project makes extensive use of CSS custom properties to enable rapid development of themes and other UI customisations.

This project is already in use as the basis of [packetscan.io](https://packetscan.io), a website built and hosted by myself. Launched in July 2023, packetscan.io quickly became the main block explorer for the PKT Cash project, with backlinks from the pkt.cash website, coinmarketcap.com, coingecko.com, and many other prominent websites.
